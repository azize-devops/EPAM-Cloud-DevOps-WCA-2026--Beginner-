1. I Can Win
   - Install git, generate SSH keys, authorize on GitHub
   - Configure user.name and user.email
   - Create repository on GitHub, clone locally
   - Create song.txt with half lyrics, commit, push
   - Add second half via GitHub, pull locally

2. Bring It On
   - Add .gitignore file
   - Create feature branch with two commits
   - Merge feature into master
   - Create arrows.txt on feature and master (different content)
   - Merge and resolve conflict

3. Hurt Me Plenty
   - Create storm branch with storm.txt
   - Add more content, make commits
   - Create pursuit.txt on master
   - Create session1 tag
   - Rebase storm on master

4. Hardcore
