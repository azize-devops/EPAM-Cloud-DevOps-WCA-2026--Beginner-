# Variables - Task

## Goals

- Use variables
- Source variables

## Tasks

1. In your home folder create a file named `vars`.

2. Add a variable called `FILE` with value `new_file` to `vars` file.

3. In your home folder create a script that does the following:
   - Has `NAME` variable equal to your `Name_Surname`
   - Sources `vars` file
   - Creates a folder with name from `NAME` variable
   - Creates a file in created folder with name from `FILE` variable
   - Lists the contents of home folder and created folder

- Script creates `Name_Surname` folder, `new_file` file in the folder and returns the following output:

```
Name_Surname script.sh vars
new_file
```
