# WHILE LOOP - TASK

GOALS:
------

- Learn to use while loop


TASKS:
------

1. Create console.sh script that does the following:
   - Implements console functionality - infinite loop that reads user input
     on each iteration
   - Supports commands:
     - ls [dir] - lists the contents of specified directory
     - pwd - shows the path to current directory
     - hi - outputs "Hello <name of the current user>"
     - exit - ends the script

2. Run your script and test implemented commands.


SELF-REVIEW:
------------

- Your script session looks like this:

  ./console.sh

  ls ~
  console.sh

  pwd
  /Users/Username/homework

  hi
  Hello Username

  exit
