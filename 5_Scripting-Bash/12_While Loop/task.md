# While Loop - Task

## Goals

- Learn to use while loop

## Tasks

1. Create `console.sh` script that does the following:
   - Implements console functionality - infinite loop that reads user input on each iteration
   - Supports commands:
     - `ls [dir]` - lists the contents of specified directory
     - `pwd` - shows the path to current directory
     - `hi` - outputs "Hello <name of the current user>"
     - `exit` - ends the script

2. Run your script and test implemented commands.

## Self-Review

- Your script session looks like this:

```bash
./console.sh

ls ~
console.sh

pwd
/Users/Username/homework

hi
Hello Username

exit
```
