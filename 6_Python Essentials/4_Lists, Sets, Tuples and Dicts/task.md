# Lists, Sets, Tuples and Dicts - Task

## Goals

- Practice working with Python data structures
- Modify existing script to improve user experience

## Tasks

1. Remember the practice task from the fifth lecture (maze/path-finding script).

2. The current script shows all its journey, including wrong paths passed on the screen step-by-step.

3. Modify the script to make it more user-friendly:
   - Show ONLY the result of work
   - Display only the picture with the answer path
   - Remove step-by-step journey output

## Self-Review

- You should see only one picture with the right path to exit
- Nothing more, nothing less

## Additional Notes

- You don't need additional lists, sets, tuples or dictionaries
- Everything you need is already in the script
- Focus on controlling what gets printed/displayed
