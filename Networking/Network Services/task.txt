2. Run the program and enable packet capture

3. Go to any web site, such as epam.com

4. Click on any of the tabs on this site

6. From the command prompt, run the command: ping 8.8.8.8

7. Stop packet capture

8. Determine the size of the smallest and largest packet

11. From which public IP address was the most IP traffic received?

12. Determine the percentage of TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets
