# CONDITIONAL AND LOOPING STATEMENTS - TASK

GOALS:
------

- Practice conditional statements (if/elseif/else)
- Use looping constructs (for, while, foreach)
- Combine conditions with loops for practical scripts


TASKS:
------

1. Write a script to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.

   Example 1:
   & .\script1.ps1 60C
   # Returns: 60C is 140 in Fahrenheit

   Example 2:
   & .\script1.ps1 45F
   # Returns: 45F is 7 in Celsius

2. Write a script to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to N.

   Example 1:
   & .\script2.ps1 50
   # Returns: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

3. Write a script to calculate a dog's age in human years.
   For the first two years, a dog year is equal to 10.5 human years.
   After that, each dog year equals 4 human years.

   Example 1:
   & .\script3.ps1 10
   # Returns: 10.5 21 25 29 33 37 41 45 49 53

4. Write a script to create the multiplication table (from 1 to 10) of a number.

   Example 1:
   & .\script4.ps1 6
   # Returns:
   6 x 1 = 6
   6 x 2 = 12
   6 x 3 = 18
   6 x 4 = 24
   6 x 5 = 30
   6 x 6 = 36
   6 x 7 = 42
   6 x 8 = 48
   6 x 9 = 54
   6 x 10 = 60


SELF-REVIEW:
------------

- Task 1: Temperature conversion works both ways (C to F, F to C)
- Task 2: Fibonacci series generated correctly up to N
- Task 3: Dog years calculated with correct formula
- Task 4: Multiplication table displays 1 to 10
