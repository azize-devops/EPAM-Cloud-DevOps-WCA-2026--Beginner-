# STRING MANIPULATIONS - TASK

GOALS:
------

- Learn string manipulation techniques in PowerShell
- Work with character arrays and sorting
- Implement case conversion logic


TASKS:
------

1. Create a new sorted string using two strings with random characters in them.
   Strings contains only letters from a to z.

   Example:
   $str1 = "xyaabbbccccdefww"
   $str2 = "xxxxyyyyabklmopq"

   Result:
   "abcdefklmopqwxy"

2. Write a script that converts dash/underscore delimited words into
   camel and pascal casing.

   Example 1:
   $inputString = "the-stealth-warrior"
   # Result: "theStealthWarrior"

   Example 2:
   $inputString = "The_Stealth_Warrior"
   # Result: "TheStealthWarrior"


SELF-REVIEW:
