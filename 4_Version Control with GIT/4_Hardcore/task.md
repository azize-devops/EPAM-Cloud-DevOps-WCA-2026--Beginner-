# Hardcore - Task

> **Note:** This task is carried out immediately after the previous one (Hurt Me Plenty).

## Tasks

1. Make a push of your repository and make sure all commits are on github.

2. Make a new repository on github.

3. Change the remote repository into the local one so that fetch and push come to the new repository that was created in the previous step.

4. Make a push and make sure that the second repository on the github looks the same as the first.

5. Return the remote settings to their initial state: pull and push of the first local repository lead to one remote repository on the github.

## Self-Review

- All commits pushed to first GitHub repository
- Second GitHub repository created
- Remote URL changed to second repository
- All commits pushed to second repository
- Both repositories on GitHub have identical content
- Remote URL restored to first repository
- `git remote -v` shows original repository URL
