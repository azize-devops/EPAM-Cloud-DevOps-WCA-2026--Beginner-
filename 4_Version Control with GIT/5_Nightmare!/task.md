# Nightmare! - Task

This is the most difficult task in this course.

## Challenge

To complete this task, you will need to repeat all 4 previous tasks using ONLY the MINGW64 command line (Git Bash).

### Rules

- You CANNOT use file managers (Windows Explorer, etc.)
- You CANNOT use GUI text editors (Notepad, VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
- You CANNOT use `gitk` / `git gui`
- You ARE ALLOWED to use the browser ONLY for GitHub operations
- Everything else is ONLY through the console

## Tasks to Repeat

### 1. I Can Win

- Install git, generate SSH keys, authorize on GitHub
- Configure `user.name` and `user.email`
- Create repository on GitHub, clone locally
- Create `song.txt` with half lyrics, commit, push
- Add second half via GitHub, pull locally

### 2. Bring It On

- Add `.gitignore` file
- Create feature branch with two commits
- Merge feature into master
- Create `arrows.txt` on feature and master (different content)
- Merge and resolve conflict

### 3. Hurt Me Plenty

- Create storm branch with `storm.txt`
- Add more content, make commits
- Create `pursuit.txt` on master
- Create `session1` tag
- Rebase storm on master

### 4. Hardcore

- Push all to GitHub
- Create second repository
- Change remote, push to second repo
- Restore original remote

## Commands That May Be Useful

## Self-Review

- All tasks completed using ONLY command line
- No GUI applications used (except browser for GitHub)
