# HURT ME PLENTY - TASK

NOTE: This task is performed after the previous one (Bring It On).


TASKS:
------

1. Create a storm branch and add a commit to the storm.txt file:

   Twenty ships with Norsemen braves
   Riding the northern wind

2. Add 2 more lines to storm.txt and make another commit:

   They left their shores at early dawn
   As a red sun was rising in the east

3. Return to master and create the pursuit.txt file with the text below:

   The warming sun returns again
   And melts away the snow
   The sea is freed from icy chains
   Winter is letting go

   Make a commit.

4. Mark the commit with session1 tag and go to the storm branch.

5. Rebase the storm branch so that it contains the last commit from the master.


SELF-REVIEW:
------------

- storm branch has two commits with storm.txt content
- master has pursuit.txt with 4 lines
- session1 tag marks the pursuit.txt commit
- After rebase, storm branch contains the pursuit.txt commit from master
- git log shows linear history after rebase
